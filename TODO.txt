IMPROVEMENTS
============

[x] Add filler column to the right.
[x] Look at moving sort details off the column and remove 'none (1).
[x] Sort appropriate groups if sorted by column.

TOTAL: 11/15

TOTAL: 14/31

FIXES
=====
[-] Clean up styling (use CSS custom variables, etc.) (2).
[x] More than one frozen column jumps a bit (especially on Firefox).
[x] After ENTER on a filter focus is lost on the input - needs to stick. Tricky because it's being caused by the :key update.
[ ] Allow row navigation if a child component has focus as well.
